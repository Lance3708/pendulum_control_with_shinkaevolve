energy_based_swing_up
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current swing-up assist relies on angular position and velocity but doesn't explicitly consider the system's mechanical energy deficit. By computing the actual energy gap between current state and upright equilibrium, we can apply more precise and efficient corrective forces. This physics-informed approach ensures we only apply significant force when truly needed, reducing unnecessary energy expenditure while maintaining rapid stabilization. The energy-based term replaces the falling_factor calculation for more accurate control during swing-up phase.
