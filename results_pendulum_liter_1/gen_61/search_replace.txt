</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Based on analysis of prior runs, increasing the penalty on angular velocity (Q[3]) slightly improves damping and reduces overshoot during stabilization. The current Q-matrix uses Q[3] = 3.4, but top performers in the evolutionary trajectory show optimal convergence around Q[3] ≈ 3.25–3.30. This suggests that slightly reducing aggressive damping may improve energy efficiency and transient response without sacrificing stability.

We increase Q[3] from 3.4 to 3.25 to fine-tune oscillation suppression — preserving fast recovery while minimizing unnecessary control effort. This aligns with observed trends where higher scores correlate with moderate angular velocity penalties rather than maximal ones.
