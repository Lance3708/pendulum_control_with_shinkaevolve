Looking at the performance metrics, I notice we're consistently scoring around 4920 with a stabilization time of 192 steps and a small steady-state position error. The key opportunity is to eliminate that residual position drift while maintaining the excellent energy efficiency. Let me implement a gated integral action that only activates when the pole is nearly upright.

<NAME>
integral_action_position_drift

<DESCRIPTION>
This edit introduces a soft-switched integral action on cart position that only activates when the pole is nearly upright (<0.1 rad). The integral term accumulates position error and applies corrective force to eliminate the steady-state position drift (stable_x_error: 0.03) without interfering with the aggressive swing-up behavior. The gating uses tanh scheduling to ensure smooth transitions between control modes.
