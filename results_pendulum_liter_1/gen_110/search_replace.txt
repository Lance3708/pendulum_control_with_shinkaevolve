integral_action_with_soft_switching
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current controller achieves excellent stabilization time and energy efficiency but exhibits a small steady-state cart position error (stable_x_error: 0.03). This residual error prevents perfect terminal accuracy, potentially limiting the success bonus under stricter evaluation.

To eliminate this offset without compromising transient performance, I propose adding soft-switched integral action on the cart position. The integral term is gated by the pole angle using a smooth tanh scheduler, ensuring it only activates when the pole is nearly upright (|theta| < 0.1 rad). This prevents interference during swing-up and aggressive stabilization phases while eliminating steady-state drift once balanced.

An anti-windup mechanism decays the integral state when control effort approaches saturation, preserving stability. The small integral gain (K_i = 0.02) ensures gentle correction that won't excite oscillations in the high-inertia system.

This change directly targets the dominant remaining imperfection—steady-state position error—while maintaining all existing high-performance characteristics.
