    Reflex-Based Triphasic Controller

    1. EMERGENCY: Rod falling fast -> push directly under it
    2. RECOVERY: Passing through vertical -> predict swing and pre-position
    3. BALANCE: Nearly upright -> tiny corrections only
    
    No matrices, no LQR, no optimal control. Just fast reflexes.
