<DESCRIPTION>
This edit refactors the controller to implement a more decisive, phase-based strategy, inspired by the highest-scoring prior solutions. The goal is to significantly reduce the stabilization time while improving final precision.

The core idea is to treat the control problem as three distinct phases: Emergency Recovery, Mid-Swing Catch, and Precision Hold.

1.  **Phase-Based Logic:** The control logic is restructured into a clear `if/elif/else` block based on the pole's angle (`theta`). This replaces the previous mixed-logic approach with distinct strategies for each phase, preventing control actions from interfering with each other inappropriately (e.g., predictive compensation is now confined to the mid-swing phase where it's most effective).

2.  **Aggressive Recovery:**
    - The swing-up assist gain in the emergency phase (`|theta| > 0.8`) is increased from `8.0` to `9.0` for faster initial correction.
    - Phase-specific cart damping (`-0.3 * dx * ...`) is added here to prevent the cart from gaining excessive velocity during aggressive maneuvers.

3.  **Enhanced Predictive "Catch":**
    - The prediction horizon for angular velocity (`dtheta_pred`) is doubled to two timesteps (`0.04s`), allowing the controller to position the cart more proactively.
    - The predictive correction gain is slightly increased to `-0.15` for a stronger effect.
    - Mid-swing damping (`K_d_midswing`) is increased to `3.0` to more effectively dissipate energy and prevent overshoot.

4.  **Faster Precision Hold & Bug Fix:**
    - A critical bug in the integral controller has been fixed: the integral force now correctly subtracts from the total force (`force - integral_force`) to oppose position error, rather than reinforcing it.
    - Strong, explicit damping (`-0.4 * dx - 0.2 * dtheta`) is introduced in the precision hold phase (`|theta| <= 0.25`) to rapidly eliminate residual oscillations and achieve stability faster.

5.  **Simplified Damping:** The complex angle-dependent cart damping has been replaced with phase-specific damping and a simple, universal light damping (`-0.1 * dx`) applied at the end. This provides consistent drift prevention without interfering with the primary control actions.

Collectively, these changes create a more intelligent, responsive, and faster controller by applying the right tool at the right time.
