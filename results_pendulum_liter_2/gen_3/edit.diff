 class Controller:
     """
-    Adaptive Cross-Coupled LQR with Mid-Swing Damping and Predictive Compensation
+    A controller based on distinct operational phases, inspired by human reflexes.
+    It switches between strategies depending on the system's state of stability.
+    This avoids a single, complex control law in favor of simple, decisive rules
+    for different situations.
 
-    Key innovations:
-    1. State-dependent cross-coupling in Q-matrix for better coordination
-    2. Mid-swing angular damping to suppress momentum overshoot
-    3. Predictive momentum compensation for earlier counteraction
-    4. Refined integral control with dual gating
+    The three phases are:
+    1. Emergency Catch: When the pole is at a large angle or falling fast. The sole
+       priority is to arrest the fall, ignoring the cart's position. This is a
+       powerful, non-linear response.
+    2. Damping & Centering: When the pole is relatively stable but the system has
+       excess energy (velocity). This phase focuses on bleeding off that energy
+       while gently guiding the cart to the center.
+    3. Precision Hold: When the system is near the target state. The focus shifts
+       to fine, energy-efficient adjustments to counteract friction and drift,
+       holding the system perfectly stable.
