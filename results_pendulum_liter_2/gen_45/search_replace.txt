<NAME>revert_ki_init</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>Revert the fixed integral gain from 1.0 back to the proven 0.85 value from the highest-scoring prior configuration (4636.78 points). This avoids overcorrection in position integral action which contributed to degraded stable_x_error (0.60 vs 0.36) and reduced success_bonus.</DESCRIPTION>
