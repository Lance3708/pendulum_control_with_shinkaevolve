  "meta_scratch_pad": "## Successful Algorithmic Patterns\n\n- **Aggressive energy-pumping swing-up combined with universal adaptive cart damping remains the cornerstone of elite performance**, as exemplified by the current best program \u201cPhase-Adaptive Controller with Energy-Efficient Damping and Enhanced Prediction\u201d (Generation 90, score: **4871.36**). It uses `u_swing = 12.0 * ...` for rapid energy injection during emergency phase while applying consistent `-0.4*dx*tanh(3.0*|\u03b8|)` damping across all phases\u2014directly enabling stabilization in just **192 steps**, the fastest among all evaluated programs.\n\n- **Direction-sensitive asymmetric integral windup limits significantly improve centering precision without sacrificing stability**, a refinement implemented in Generation 90 (`lower_limit = -(1.2 + 0.6*|x|) + 0.3*min(0,x)`, etc.) that reduces final_x_error to **0.80**, outperforming Generations 91 (**~1.09**) and 92 (**>1.0 implied**). This technique allows more aggressive integral buildup when far from center while preserving corrective headroom\u2014critical for maximizing success and time bonuses.\n\n- **Predictive momentum compensation gated by angle magnitude enables robust mid-swing control without destabilizing swing-up**, as seen in both Generation 90 and Generation 92 (\u201cPhase-Reflex Inverted Pendulum Controller\u201d, score: **4335.53**). Both compute full nonlinear dynamics for `theta_acc_est` and apply corrections only when `abs_theta > 0.25` modulated via `tanh(2.5*|\u03b8|)`. This approach effectively manages extreme initial conditions (1.02 rad) while maintaining exceptional energy efficiency (**avg_energy_per_step: 0.01**).\n\n- **Three-phase adaptive architecture with emergency pumping, recovery damping, and LQR-based balancing continues to dominate top-tier performance**, consistently delivering scores above **4300**. The current best (Gen 90, **4871.36**) builds directly on Generation 75\u2019s blueprint but refines phase transitions through partial integral reset (`self.integral_x *= 0.5`) and enhanced stability-gated position correction, proving that *incremental enhancements to this core structure yield compounding gains*.\n\n## Ineffective Approaches\n\n- **Moderate or incomplete implementation of universal cart damping leads to excessive positional drift despite strong swing-up logic**, as evidenced by Generation 91 (\u201cprincipled_integral_feedback\u201d, score: **4308.88**) which reports a **final_x_error of ~1.09 m**\u2014worse than even Generation 80\u2019s **0.90**. Its lack of consistent `-0.4*dx*tanh(3.0*|\u03b8|)` damping across phases results in poor centering, directly limiting its score despite otherwise sound phase logic.\n\n- **Overly conservative predictive damping or insufficient swing-up aggression caps stabilization speed**, illustrated by Generation 92 (\u201cenhanced_recovery_phase_with_asymmetric_integral\u201d, score: **4335.53**) which stabilizes in **266 steps**\u2014significantly slower than Generation 90\u2019s **192**. Although it uses physics-informed swing-up and asymmetric integral control, its reduced mid-swing damping gain (`K_d_midswing = 3.0` vs. earlier versions\u2019 6.0) likely delays convergence, costing valuable time bonus points.\n\n- **Incomplete integration of position-coupled adaptive gains in the balancing phase limits final accuracy**, as seen in Generation 94 (\u201cphase_adaptive_centering_hybrid\u201d, score: **4368.69**) which stabilizes quickly (**206 steps**) but still exhibits moderate final_x_error (implied >0.8 based on feedback). Unlike Generation 90 and especially Generation 75, it lacks refined direction-sensitive integral limits and state-dependent position correction gains, preventing elite centering.\n\n- **Stabilization without convergence to true goal state yields inflated scores but fails validation**, demonstrated by Generation 98 (\u201cReflex-Based Predictive Stabilizer\u201d, score: **979.39**) which maintains perfect stabilization ratio (**1.00**) over 1000 steps but fails due to large final position/angle errors. This highlights that *over-stabilization without active centering mechanisms cannot achieve high scores*, regardless of energy efficiency or stability duration.\n\n## Implementation Insights\n\n- **The current best program (Gen 90) implements direction-sensitive asymmetric integral windup limits that dynamically expand based on displacement magnitude and bias toward corrective action**: `lower_limit = -(1.2 + 0.6*|x|) + 0.3*min(0,x)` and symmetric upper bound. This allows more aggressive integral buildup when far from center while preserving headroom for correction\u2014directly contributing to its **final_x_error of 0.80**, the second-best among new evaluations after Generation 75\u2019s **0.29**.\n\n- **Universal adaptive cart damping (`-0.4*dx*tanh(3.0*|\u03b8|)`) is now standard in top performers**, appearing identically in both Generation 90 and the historical best (Gen 75). This single line provides consistent velocity suppression scaled to pole instability, reducing oscillations during recovery and minimizing interference near balance\u2014key to achieving **avg_energy_per_step: 0.01** while maintaining fast stabilization (**192 steps**).\n\n- **Stability-gated position correction in balancing phase enhances centering without destabilization**, as implemented in Generation 90 via `stability_factor = np.exp(-6.0*(theta\u00b2 + 0.25*dtheta\u00b2))` and active threshold `>0.15`. This ensures stronger position feedback (`gain up to 2.5`) only when the system is sufficiently stable, avoiding over-correction\u2014a refinement absent in lower-scoring variants like Generation 91.\n\n- **Partial integral reset (`self.integral_x *= 0.5`) on entry to balancing mode prevents windup carryover**, a targeted technique used in Generation 90 and echoed in patch names like Generation 93\u2019s \u201cprecision_centering_refinement\u201d. This smooths the handoff from high-energy swing-up to precision control, supporting rapid convergence without destabilization\u2014critical for maximizing time bonus under challenging initial conditions (1.02 rad).\n\n## Performance Analysis\n\n- **The current best program (Gen 90, 4871.36) surpasses even Generation 75 (4713.11) by 158.25 points**, primarily through faster stabilization (**192 vs. 214 steps**) and superior energy deployment strategy, despite slightly worse final_x_error (**0.80 vs. 0.29**). This confirms that *strategic energy use during early phases can outweigh minor centering deficits* when time and success bonuses are maximized.\n\n- **Final cart position error remains the primary differentiator among otherwise successful controllers**: All top programs achieve near-zero final_theta_error (**\u22640.01**), but scores correlate strongly with final_x_error\u2014Generation 90 (**0.80**, **4871.36**) outperforms Generation 91 (**~1.09**, **4308.88**) by **562.48 points**, validating that *sub-meter centering is essential for elite performance*.\n\n- **Energy efficiency alone does not guarantee high scores**: Generation 92 achieves excellent **avg_energy_per_step: 0.01** but scores only **4335.53** due to slower stabilization (**266 steps**) and likely higher final_x_error. In contrast, Generation 90 matches the same energy efficiency while stabilizing **74 steps faster**, capturing significantly more time bonus (**2233.79 vs. ~1800 estimated**).\n\n- **Programs implementing the full suite of Generation 75\u2019s refinements plus new enhancements consistently exceed 4700 points**: Generation 90 (**4871.36**) and Generation 93 (**4724.01**) both integrate universal damping, three-phase logic, predictive correction, and advanced integral control\u2014demonstrating that *omitting any one elite component (e.g., asymmetric windup in Gen 93) creates a measurable performance ceiling*.",
  "meta_recommendations": "1. **Amplify direction-sensitive integral windup limits with exponential displacement scaling**  \n   Replace the current linear expansion factor (`0.6 * abs(x)`) in the asymmetric integral bounds with an exponential term like `0.8 * (np.exp(0.7 * abs(x)) - 1)`. This builds directly on Generation 90\u2019s successful asymmetric design and mirrors Generation 75\u2019s elite centering (0.29 m error), potentially reducing final_x_error below 0.5 by enabling more aggressive corrective integral buildup during large excursions while preserving tight control near origin.\n\n2. **Reinstate stronger mid-swing damping with refined divergence-aware gating**  \n   Increase the recovery-phase damping gain from `K_d_midswing = 3.0` back to ~5.0\u20136.0 but modulate it using a sharper divergence metric: `is_moving_away = np.clip(np.tanh(5.0 * theta * dtheta), 0, 1)`. This addresses Generation 92\u2019s slowdown issue while retaining energy efficiency\u2014leveraging the existing predictive momentum compensation\u2014to accelerate stabilization closer to 180 steps without destabilizing, directly boosting time bonus beyond the current 2233.79.\n\n3. **Decouple centrifugal force from predictive correction authority in recovery phase**  \n   In the `theta_acc_est` calculation for predictive compensation, compute full dynamics for state prediction but exclude the centrifugal term `(m * l * dtheta\u00b2 * sin(theta)) / Mtot` when determining `pred_divergence`. This prevents overestimation of effective pole inertia during high-velocity swings\u2014critical given the heavy/long pole\u2014and improves correction accuracy under extreme initial conditions (1.02 rad), enhancing robustness without adding complexity.\n\n4. **Implement position-dependent LQR Q-weight scheduling in balancing phase**  \n   Dynamically scale the LQR\u2019s position weight `Q[0,0]` based on cart displacement: increase it by up to 50% via `Q[0,0] = 4.5 * (1.0 + 0.5 * np.tanh(1.8 * (abs(x) - 0.6)))` when `|x| > 0.6`, while slightly reducing angular weights. Since the current best already uses stability-gated position correction, this deepens synergy between LQR and integral control, potentially driving final_x_error from 0.80 toward Generation 75\u2019s 0.29 without sacrificing stability.\n\n5. **Introduce lightweight online joint friction adaptation using acceleration residuals**  \n   Every 18 steps in recovery/balancing phases, estimate joint friction mismatch via residual: `residual = (dtheta_new - dtheta_old)/DT - theta_acc_est`, then update `self.b_j += 0.008 * residual * dtheta` and recompute `denominator` and A-matrix entries. This counters model error from high joint friction (0.25)\u2014a known challenge\u2014and preserves fidelity of both predictive compensation and LQR actions, improving consistency across diverse initial conditions with minimal computational overhead.",

    "1. **Enhance predictive compensation with second-order state extrapolation**: The current best program uses a simplified gravity-dominated estimate of angular acceleration for predictive correction. Extend this by incorporating cart acceleration effects into the prediction model (using dx and x terms from the full dynamics) to compute a more accurate dtheta_pred over a 2\u20133 step horizon, which could further reduce overshoot during swing-up transitions.\n\n2. **Introduce adaptive integral gain scheduling based on stability margin**: While dual-gated integral action prevents windup effectively, the fixed K_i = 0.85 may be suboptimal across varying energy regimes. Implement a stability-margin-dependent K_i that scales inversely with |\u03b8| + |d\u03b8| near equilibrium (e.g., K_i = 0.85 \u00d7 exp(\u2212\u03b1(|\u03b8| + |d\u03b8|))) to minimize corrective lag without risking instability during transient phases.\n\n3. **Refine mid-swing damping with velocity-phase-aware activation**: The Gaussian activation centered at 0.5 rad works well but doesn\u2019t account for direction of motion. Modify the mid_swing_activation to include a sign-sensitive term (e.g., multiply by tanh(\u03b2\u00b7\u03b8\u00b7d\u03b8)) so damping is stronger when the pole is moving away from upright (\u03b8\u00b7d\u03b8 > 0) and reduced when returning, improving energy efficiency during recovery.\n\n4. **Embed friction-adaptive LQR tuning via online parameter estimation**: The current A matrix uses nominal friction coefficients, but high joint/cart friction significantly alters effective dynamics. Add lightweight recursive least squares (RLS) or gradient-based updates to adjust b_c and b_j estimates online using observed state derivatives, then recompute Q-coupling or K gains every N steps to maintain optimality under real friction conditions.\n\n5. **Add cross-state energy-aware gain modulation using Lyapunov-inspired metrics**: Leverage the observed correlation between low energy usage and success by introducing a composite \u201cenergy-risk\u201d metric (e.g., E_risk = 0.5\u00b7dx\u00b2 + M_POLE\u00b7G\u00b7L_COM\u00b7(1\u2212cos\u03b8)) to modulate adaptive_gain. Scale gains down when E_risk exceeds a threshold to avoid aggressive corrections that waste energy, while preserving responsiveness near the separatrix where precise actuation is critical.",
    "1. **Enhance predictive compensation with cart-acceleration-aware angular acceleration estimation**: The current best program uses a gravity-dominated estimate for `theta_acc_est`, but neglects the influence of cart acceleration on pole dynamics. Incorporate the term `(dx_dot * cos(theta)) / L_COM` into the angular acceleration prediction by approximating `dx_dot` from recent state differences or using the current control force and system parameters. This would yield a more accurate `dtheta_pred`, improving early counteraction during aggressive swing-up phases.\n\n2. **Implement adaptive integral gain scheduling based on proximity to equilibrium**: Replace the fixed `K_i = 0.85` with a gain that scales as `K_i = 0.85 * exp(-2.0 * (abs(theta) + 0.5*abs(dtheta)))`. This leverages the dual-gating mechanism already in place but further reduces integral aggressiveness during transients while maintaining full correction near steady state, minimizing corrective lag without risking windup\u2014directly addressing observed minor position drift (`stable_x_error: 0.14`).\n\n3. **Make mid-swing damping direction-sensitive using phase-plane logic**: Modify the `midswing_damp` term by multiplying it with `tanh(3.0 * theta * dtheta)` so that damping is amplified when the pole is moving away from upright (`theta * dtheta > 0`) and attenuated when returning toward center (`theta * dtheta < 0`). This builds on the successful Gaussian activation but adds motion-awareness, reducing unnecessary energy expenditure during recovery while preserving overshoot suppression during divergence.\n\n4. **Introduce online friction adaptation via lightweight recursive updates**: Add a simple gradient-based estimator that adjusts `b_c` and `b_j` every 20 steps using observed state derivatives: e.g., compute residual between predicted and actual `dtheta` and update `b_j += lr * residual * dtheta`. Then recompute the cross-coupling boost or LQR gains using updated friction estimates. This extends the physics-aware design principle while compensating for the high-friction environment that significantly alters effective dynamics.\n\n5. **Add Lyapunov-inspired energy-risk modulation to adaptive gain**: Compute a real-time \u201cenergy-risk\u201d metric `E_risk = 0.5*M_CART*dx**2 + M_POLE*G*L_COM*(1 - np.cos(theta))` and scale the `adaptive_gain` down when `E_risk > threshold` (e.g., `adaptive_gain *= min(1.0, 1.5 / (1.0 + E_risk))`). This directly implements the insight that low-energy, intelligent actuation correlates with success, preventing over-correction in high-energy states while preserving responsiveness near the separatrix where precise control is critical.",
    "1. **Enhance predictive compensation with explicit cart-acceleration coupling in angular dynamics**: Replace the current estimated `x_acc = force / Mtot - b_c*dx / Mtot` with a more accurate approximation that accounts for pole-induced reaction forces by incorporating the term `(m * l * dtheta**2 * sin(theta)) / Mtot` into `x_acc`. This yields a better `theta_acc_est`, improving prediction fidelity during high-energy swing-up\u2014directly extending the successful predictive momentum compensation already present.\n\n2. **Implement direction-aware mid-swing damping using phase-plane sign logic**: Modify the `midswing_damp` term to be multiplied by `np.tanh(3.0 * theta * dtheta)`, so damping is active only when the pole is moving away from upright (`theta * dtheta > 0`). This preserves energy during recovery phases while maintaining overshoot suppression, building on the Gaussian activation\u2019s success but adding motion-direction intelligence to reduce unnecessary actuation.\n\n3. **Introduce adaptive integral gain scheduling based on joint proximity to equilibrium**: Replace the fixed `K_i = 0.85` with `K_i = 0.85 * np.exp(-2.0 * (abs(theta) + 0.5*abs(dtheta)))`, which dynamically reduces integral aggressiveness during transients while preserving full correction near steady state. This refines the existing dual-gating mechanism to further minimize the observed `stable_x_error: 0.14` without risking windup.\n\n4. **Add lightweight online friction adaptation via recursive residual correction**: Every 20 steps, compute the residual between predicted and actual `dtheta` using the current dynamics model, then update `b_j += 0.01 * residual * dtheta` and recompute `denom0` and LQR-relevant terms. This extends the physics-aware design principle to compensate for high joint friction, which significantly distorts effective torque\u2014a known challenge in this environment.\n\n5. **Modulate adaptive gain using a Lyapunov-inspired energy-risk metric**: Compute real-time mechanical energy `E_risk = 0.5*M_CART*dx**2 + M_POLE*G*L_COM*(1 - np.cos(theta))` and scale `adaptive_gain *= min(1.0, 1.5 / (1.0 + E_risk))` when `E_risk > 1.2`.
